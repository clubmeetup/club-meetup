## Overview

The problem: UH Manoa has over 200 Registered Independent Organizations, plus many more that do not have this “official” status but are nonetheless active organizations. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for students to learn (a) what student clubs (both registered and unregistered) exist, what they do, and how to get further involved.

The solution: The Club Meetup application will provide a centralized directory for UH Manoa student clubs. UH Manoa students can login to browse a well organized directory of all current student clubs, with brief descriptions, meeting times and locations, URLs to their websites (if any), contact information for officers, and a few select photos.

## Deployment

## Developer Guide

This section provides information of interest to Meteor developers wishing to use this code base as a basis for their own development tasks.

### Installation

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, visit the [Club Up application github page](https://github.com/), and click the "Use this template" button to create your own repository initialized with a copy of this application. Alternatively, you can download the sources as a zip file or make a fork of the repo.  However you do it, download a copy of the repo to your local computer.

Third, cd into the Club Up/app directory and install libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

Fourth, run the system with:

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

If all goes well, the application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Application Design

Club Up is based upon [meteor-application-template-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template-react/) and [meteor-example-form-react](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-example-form-react/). Please use the videos and documentation at those sites to better acquaint yourself with the basic application design and form processing in Bowfolios.


## Initialization

The [config](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/tree/main/config) directory is intended to hold settings files.  The repository contains one file: [config/settings.development.json](https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios/blob/main/config/settings.development.json).

This file contains default definitions for Profiles, Projects, and Interests and the relationships between them. Consult the walkthrough video for more details.

The settings.development.json file contains a field called "loadAssetsFile". It is set to false, but if you change it to true, then the data in the file app/private/data.json will also be loaded.  The code to do this illustrates how to initialize a system when the initial data exceeds the size limitations for the settings file.
